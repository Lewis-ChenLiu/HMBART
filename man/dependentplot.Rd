\title{Generate Dependent Variable Plots for NDE and NIE Effects}
\usage{
dependentplot(hmbart_obj, varname)
}
\arguments{
\item{hmbart_obj}{An object returned by the \code{hmbart} function, containing data, covariates, and effect estimates.}

\item{varname}{A character string specifying the name of the variable to be plotted.}
}
\value{
A combined plot displaying both the estimated effects (NDE and NIE) and smoothed trends
generated by GAM with 95\% confidence intervals.
}
\description{
This function creates visualizations to explore the relationship between a specified variable
and the estimated Natural Direct Effects (NDE) and Natural Indirect Effects (NIE) using
generalized additive models (GAM) and point-wise confidence intervals.
}
\details{
The function divides NDE and NIE estimates into significant and non-significant groups based on
confidence intervals. It applies splines via GAM to visualize smooth relationships between the
variable and effects. Both point estimates and smoothed trends are displayed for interpretability.
