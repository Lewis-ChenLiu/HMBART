\title{Generate Decision Tree Plots for NDE and NIE Effects}
\usage{
treeplot(hmbart_obj, cp = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{hmbart_obj}{An object returned by the \code{hmbart} function, containing data, covariates, and effect estimates.}

\item{cp}{Complexity parameter for pruning the decision trees. Default is 0.01. Smaller values result in more complex trees.}
}
\value{
Displays two side-by-side decision tree plots summarizing the NDE and NIE effects based on covariates.
}
\description{
This function creates decision tree visualizations to illustrate the relationship between covariates
and the estimated Natural Direct Effects (NDE) and Natural Indirect Effects (NIE).
}
\details{
The function uses the \code{rpart} package to fit decision trees for the NDE and NIE estimates.
Decision trees provide an interpretable structure to examine how covariates influence the effects,
with splits that highlight important features and thresholds.
